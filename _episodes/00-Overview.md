### Introduction

The term "reproducibility" conjures a mental image of dedicated systems
conducting automated and repeatable computations.  However, **you** can
embrace reproducibility as a principle to apply to your day-to-day
research activities.  Neuroimaging is a heavily data- and software- driven
field of science.  As a result, by learning more tricks and techniques
for the tools that you already use daily, you will discover ways to
not only improve your efficiency but also to increase the reproducibility of
your research.

To some degree, reproducibility requires knowledge of **what**,
**when**, and **how** any particular analysis was carried out.
Therefore the lessons in this module will focus on helping
answer those questions.  Before addressing these specific questions,
referenced external materials (tutorials, lessons, etc) will provide a
more generic and thorough presentation of the topics.


### Who is this module for?

The module is for any scientist, researcher, or a student who is using
software for data analysis, writing custom code or editing documents.

> Depending on your level of competence in any particular topic, you

> very proficient in all of those topics, we hope that you can still
> learn some new "tricks" or are willing to recommend or contribute new
> materials to the lessons.

### How much time should this take?

That primarily depends on your familiarity and experience with working
in command line/shell, using version control systems, managing
software environments, having experience providing constructive
feedback about defects you found in software you use, etc. All those
topics seem independent but are also very much related, so it is likely
that you might have some familiarity with all of them, or that you know
just one of them well.  If you have no experience with any topic,
this may take you a long time: for instance, 5 to 7 full days. If you
are experienced, some of the information may be redundant and it may take
you only a few hours to go through this material in detail. In each
lesson, we provide an estimate for the time it would take to learn
the lesson, assuming you have a basic understanding of the topic.

### How should the acquired knowledge be used?

It is important to **apply** the knowledge gained from the lessons to
your day-to-day activities as soon as possible! Start using shell
and/or do it more efficiently by using shortcuts, scripting, making
those scripts robust, etc. Use version control systems for anything
you change (code, data, documents) and increase "traceable" collaboration
exchange, even if it’s just between you on computer 1 and you on
computer 2. Get curious and check what you are using; start
provisioning your own computation environments. Report problems you
run into and don’t just leave them unresolved.

An efficient approach to learning the materials is to first skim
through all the materials, noting the key concepts and applying them
right away. Then, after gaining experience and stumbling upon some
problems, it will be useful to review the relevant topic in greater
detail while concentrating on the relevant aspects.

**The least efficient approach would be to spend a week "learning
it" only to forget all of it by not using any of the learned tools
or recommended practices.**

### What are the lessons in this module?

This module guides through three somewhat independent topics, which
are at the heart of establishing and efficiently using common generic
resources: command line shell, version control systems (for code and
data), distribution package managers, and a few additional aspects such
as bug reporting and licensing.  It is very unlikely that you have
managed to completely avoid using those tools in past research activities,
but it is possible that you have under-utilized their capabilities.
Gaining additional skills in any of these topics can not only help
your day-to-day research activities become more efficient, but
also lay the foundation for establishing habits that will make your work
more reproducible.  Moreover, these topics are the foundation of future
modules in the ReproNim curriculum.
