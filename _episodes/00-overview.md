### Introduction

The term "reproducibility" conjures a mental image of dedicated systems
conducting automated and repeatable computations.  However, **you** can
embrace reproducibility in your day-to-day research activities.
Neuroimaging is a heavily data- and software-driven field of science.
As a result, by learning best practices for the tools you already use daily,
you will discover ways to improve your efficiency and increase the
reproducibility of your research.

Reproducibility requires us to know the **what**, **when**, and **how**
for any particular analysis we carry out. The lessons in this module will
help us answer those questions. Before addressing these specific questions,
consult the referenced external materials (tutorials, lessons, etc.) to get a
more generic and thorough treatment of the topics.


### Who is this module for?

This module is for any scientist, researcher, or student who is using
software for data analysis, writing custom code, or editing documents.

> willing to recommend or contribute new materials to the lessons.

### How much time should this take?

This depends on your familiarity with the command line/shell, version
control systems, managing software environments, etc. All of these
topics may seem independent but are in fact very much related; it's likely
that you might have some familiarity with all of them, or that you know
just one of them well. If you have no experience with any topic,
this may take you a long time: for instance, 5 to 7 full days. If you're
already experienced, some of the information may be redundant and it may take
you only a few hours to go through the material in detail. In each
lesson, we provide an estimate for the time it would take to learn
the lesson, assuming you have a basic understanding of the topic.

### How should the acquired knowledge be used?

The most important lesson is to **apply** the knowledge you gain to
your day-to-day activities as soon as possible! Start using shell
and/or do it more efficiently by using shortcuts, scripting, making
those scripts robust, etc. Use version control systems for anything
you change (code, data, documents) and increase "traceable" collaboration
exchange, even if it’s just between you on computer 1 and you on
computer 2. Get curious and check what you are using; start
provisioning your own computation environments. Report problems you
run into and don’t just leave them unresolved.

An efficient approach to learning the materials is to first skim
through all the materials, noting the key concepts and applying them
right away. Then, after gaining experience and stumbling on some
problems, review the relevant topic in greater detail.

**The least efficient approach would be to spend a week "learning
it" only to forget all of it by not using any of the learned tools
or recommended practices.**

### What are the lessons in this module?

This module introduces three somewhat independent topics at the heart of
efficient and reproducible scientific computing: command line/shell,
version control systems (for code and data), distribution package managers,
and a few additional aspects such as bug reporting and licensing. It's
unlikely that you've managed to completely avoid those tools so far,
but it's possible that you've under-utilized their capabilities.
Gaining additional skills in any of these topics can not only help
your day-to-day research activities become more efficient, but
also lay the groundwork for establishing habits that will make your work
more reproducible. Moreover, these topics are the foundation of future
modules in the ReproNim curriculum.
