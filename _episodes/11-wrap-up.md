## Sum everything up for yourself.

You can mention specific external resources that were helpful, or particular exercises that did (or didn’t) help you understand a concept. As previously mentioned, the best way to learn these practices is by **doing** (second only to teaching others!). Keeping a record of your hands-on experiences with reproducible practices will help you permanently adopt these practices in your research.
