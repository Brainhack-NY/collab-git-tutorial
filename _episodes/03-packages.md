## What is a â€œpackage manager" and its relation to "distributions"

Installation and maintenance of the computing environments is a tedious and 
error-prone task if you had to download, build, test, and install each 
software package manually one by one, from various locations on the web. Moreover,
how would you be able to guarantee that the software version you installed 
yesterday would be identical to the software you install today?

To standardize and automate delivery of software to users, "package managers"
are created to wrap each software product into one (or more) packages, with all
necessary meta-data, so that they could be installed on the system via the same
package management interface regardless of the software origin, programming
language, etc.  Moreover, package managers provide detailed versioning, 
dependencies, and other meta-data which helps to guarantee consistency and 
reproducibility of the computing environment installations.

Distributions, and software distributions in particular, use a manager to 
establish a collection of packages they host (so they centralize delivery) and
provide for installation.  This way, the same package manager platform 
could be used by multiple distributions.  For instance, Debian (and its 
derived distributions, such as Ubuntu) use **APT** package manager, Anaconda 
and miniconda use **conda** package manager, etc.

In the following units we would like to overview the most commonly used in
neuroimaging software and data distributions, and some of their specifics for
establishing unambigously specific and reproducible computing environments.


## Debian

Debian is the largest community-driven open source project, and one of the 
oldest Linux distributions.  Its platform and package format (DEB) and package 
manager (APT) became very popular, especially after Debian was chosen to be the
base for many derivatives such as Ubuntu and Mint.   At the moment Debian provides
over 40,000 binary packages virtually for any field of
endeavour including many scientific applications.  Any number of those packages could be very easily
installed via a unified interface of the APT package manager and with clear information 
about versioning, licensing, etc.  Interestingly, almost all Debian packages now 
are  themselves guaranteed to be reproducible 
(see [Debian: Reproducible Builds](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds).  

Because of such variety, wide range of support hardware, acknowledged stability,
adherence to principles of open and free software, Debian is a very popular
"base OS" for either direct installation on hardware, or in the cloud or
containers (docker or singularity).

Debian (and its derivative) distributions typically provide only the single most recent
version of a software package.  It is done so by design, thus to guarantee that all 
available software in the released version of Debian work correctly together.  
If multiple versions were allowed and be present, including possibly newer 
ones, it would be impossible to provide such a guarantee.  But often it is needed 
to install a more recent version of the package.  For this purpose 
[Debian backports](http://backports.debian.org) provides an APT repository for
stable releases of Debian with some package versions brought from Debian testing.
Enabling backports APT repository makes it possible to install more recent versions of packages
on top of the stable Debian release.  This way multiple versions of the package
might be made available -- one (or even more if `/updates` suite was also added)
from Debian proper, and some newer version from backports, and it is clear that one version
is considered stable, and another one possibly less tested. 

One of the most useful commands to discover details about the available versions
of software (if operating just in the shell), is `apt policy`.

- `apt policy` shows information about all enabled APT repositories

- `apt policy PACKAGE` command shows installed and available version(s) of the
  `PACKAGE`.


Indispensible resource for reproducibility is the 
[Debian snapshots](http://snapshots.debian.org) archive. It provides access to 
the states of all aforementioned APT repositories, as they were provided in the past.
This allows to obtain any previously present in those APT repositories version of
the package.


## NeuroDebian

[NeuroDebian](http://neuro.debian.net) project was established to integrate
software used for research in psychology and
neuroimaging within standard Debian distribution.  The majority of the packages 
maintained by the NeuroDebian team get uploaded to Debian unstable and then 
propagate to Debian and Ubuntu releases.

To facilitate access to the most recent versions
of such software on already existing releases of Debian and its most popular 
[derivative](https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives) [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com),
NeuroDebian project established its own 
[APT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(Debian)) repository.  So, in a vein, 
such repository is similar to [Debian backports](https://backports.debian.org/)
repository, but a) it also 
supports Ubuntu releases, b) typically backport builds are 
uploaded to NeuroDebian as soon as they are uploaded to Debian unstable, c) contains
some packages which did not make it to Debian proper yet.

To enable NeuroDebian on your standard Debian or Ubuntu machine, you could 
`apt-get install neurodebian` (and follow the interactive dialogue) or just follow 
the instructions on http://neuro.debian.net .

If you are using [Docker](http://docker.io), 
[NeuroDebian Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/_/neurodebian/) are provided for all 
supported Debian and Ubuntu releases.  If you are using [Singularity]()

## Conda

[conda] is a package manager which was initially developed and use for
[Anaconda] product, but because of its openness became used to establish
independent popular conda "channels", such as [conda-forge] and [bioconda].
Distinguishing feature of `conda` is not requiring root/super-user access
for its installation and management.  Although largely Python-oriented,
`conda` distributions are not limited only to Python-based projects.

## DataLad

DataLad is both a version control system (for code and data) and a
distribution, since it provides mechanisms for aggregating multiple
"packages" so they could be found, installed, uninstalled, updated, etc.  
Aggregation of multiple datasets is done via
[git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) mechanism, 
and a dataset containing other datasets is called a 
[superdataset](http://docs.datalad.org/en/latest/glossary.html) in DataLad. 
One of such super-datasets is provided from http://datasets.datalad.org and it 
aggregates hundreds of neural datasets over 10TB in size total.
To learn about DataLad, we refer you to the [VCS lesson:DataLad](/02-vcs/#datalad).
