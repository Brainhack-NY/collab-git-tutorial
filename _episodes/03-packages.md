title: "Package managers and distributions"
teaching: 90
exercises: 30
questions:
- What are the benefits of using package managers and distribution?
- How can we establish and control computation environments using
  available package managers and distributions?
- Which distribution(s) suits best my needs and use-cases?
objectives:
- Explain the differences between available distributions and package
  managers
- Teach how it is possible to (re-)create a computational environment
  given a set of requirements (packages/versions)
keypoints:
- "Package managers and distributions allow for the efficient creation of tightly
  version-controlled computation environments"

## DataLad

DataLad is both a version control system (for code and data) and a
distribution, since it provides mechanisms for aggregating multiple
"packages" so they could be found, installed, uninstalled, updated, etc.

To learn about DataLad, we refer you to the [VCS lesson:DataLad](/02-vcs/#datalad).
