title: "Version control systems"
teaching: 210
exercises: TODO
questions:
- How could use of version control systems help reproducibility?
objectives:
- Familiarize with an available variety of version control systems and
  tools based on them
keypoints:
- Using VCS could not only facilitate reproducibility but also improve
  sharing and collaborations
- "VCS could be used directly or serve a foundation for domain-specific tools"

## What is a â€œversion control system" (VCS)?

- Just two words on its purpose
- VCS systems are in large "provenance trackers for human activities"
  but could be used to track results from automation (scripts, etc)

### sumatra

A tool for managing and tracking projects based on numerical
simulation and/or analysis in computational neuroscience, with the aim
of supporting reproducible research. It can be thought of as an
automated electronic lab notebook for computational projects.
