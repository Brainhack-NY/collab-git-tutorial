## What is a â€œversion control system" ([VCS])?

We all probably do some level of version control of our files,
documents, and even data files, but without a version control **system** ([VCS])
we do it in an ad-hoc manner:

[![A Story Told in File Names by Jorge Cham, http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive_print.php?comicid=1323](../fig/borrowed/phd052810s.png)](http://www.phdcomics.com)

So, in general, VCS systems help to **track versions** of digital artifacts
such as code (scripts, source files), configuration files, images,
documents, data -- original or generated (as outcome of the analysis).
With proper annotation of changes, VCS becomes the lab notebook for
changing content in the digital world.  Since all versions are stored,
VCS makes it possible to provide any previous version at any later
point in time.  You can see how it could be important for reproducing
previous results -- if your work's history is stored in a VCS, you just
need to get a previous version of your materials and carry out the
analysis using it.  You can also recover a file which you mistakenly
removed since previous version would be contained within VCS, so no
more "the cat ate my source code". For those features alone it is
worthwhile placing any materials you produce and care about under
some appropriate VCS.

Besides tracking changes, another main function of VCS is
**collaboration**. VCSs are typically used not only locally but across multiple
hosts. Any modern VCS supports
transfer and aggregation of versions of (or changes to) your
work among collaborators.  By using some public services (such as
[github]) you can also make them available to other online services
(such as [travis-ci](http://travis-ci.org)) 
that could be configured to react to any new change you
introduce and to perform prescribed actions.  Integration with such
services, which could automatically reanalyse data and
and verify that expected results still hold, provides another big benefit for
guaranteeing correct computations and reproducibility.

In this module we will first learn about

- general use of [Git] as a VCS to maintain not-so-large files (code,
configuration, text, etc)
- 3rd-party services worth learning to integrate with your VCS on
public hosting portals (e.g. on [github])
- VCS geared for managing data files ([git-annex], [datalad])
- additional VCS-based tools that could help you to get better
control of your digital research artifacts and notes.

## 3rd party services

As you have learned in [Remotes in GitHub](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/07-github/)
section of the [Software Carpentry Git course](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/),
[github] website provides you a public (or private) storage for your Git repositories on the web.
GitHub website also allows 3rd-party websites to interact with your repositories 
to provide additional services, typically in a response to your submission of new changes
to your repositories. Visit [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace) for an
overview of the vast collection of such additional services.  Some services are free,
some are "pay-for-service".  Students could benefit from obtaining a 
[Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) to gain free access to
some services which otherwise would require a fee.

### Continuous integration

There is a growing number of online services providing 
**continuous integration** ([CI]) services.  Although free tier unlikely to provide
you with sufficient resources to carry out entire data analysis on your data,
you are encouraged to use CIs to verify your code reproducible and correct execution 
on a set of unit-tests using "toy"/simulated data or on a subset of the real dataset.
For example, see [simple workflow](https://github.com/ReproNim/simple_workflow) code for
the [A very simple, re-executable neuroimaging publication](https://f1000research.com/articles/6-124/)).


#### Travis CI

[Travis CI] was one of the first free continuous integration services integrated
with GitHub.  It is free for projects available publicly on [github].

## Git-annex

[git-annex] is a tool which allows to manage data files within a [git] repository,
without committing (large) content of those data files directly under git.
In a nutshell, [git-annex]

- moves actual data file(s) under `.git/annex/objects`, into a file typically 
  named according to the [checksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum) of 
  the file's content, and in its place creates a symlink pointing to that new 
  location
- commits that symlink (not actual data) under git, so a file of any size
  would have the same small footprint within git
- within `git-annex` branch records information about where (on which 
  machine/clone or web URL), that data file is available from

so later on, if you have access to the clones of the repository which have the
copy of the file, you could easily `get` it (which will download/copy that file
under `.git/annex/objects`) or `drop` it (which would remove that file from 
`.git/annex/objects`).

As a result of git not containing the actual content of those large files, but 
instead containing just symlinks, and information within `git-annex` branch, it 
becomes possible to

- have very lean [git] repositories, pointing to arbitrarily large files
- share such repositories on any git hosting portal (e.g. [github]).  Just do
  not forget also to push `git-annex` branch which would contain information
  about
- very quickly switch (i.e. checkout) between different states of the repository,
  because no large file would need to be created -- just symlinks

### Note

Never `git merge` `git-annex` branch manually.  [git-annex] uses special merge
algorithm to merge data availability information, and you should use 
[git annex merge](https://git-annex.branchable.com/git-annex-merge/) 
or [git annex sync](https://git-annex.branchable.com/git-annex-sync/)
commands to have `git-annex` branch merged correctly.

> ## How to add file a.txt directly under git, and file b.dat under git-annex?

> % git add a.txt
> % git annex add b.dat

> ~~~
> % cat << EOF > .gitattributes
> * annex.largefiles=(not(mimetype=text/*))
> *.dat annex.largefiles=anything
> EOF
> ~~~

## Additional relevant helpers

- [sumatra](http://neuralensemble.org/sumatra) - manages
  and tracks projects based on numerical simulation or analysis,
  with the aim of supporting reproducible research. It can be thought
  of as an ''automated electronic lab notebook'' for
  simulation/analysis projects.

- [noworkflow](https://github.com/gems-uff/noworkflow) - captures a
  variety of provenance information and provides some analyses such
  as graph-based visualization, differencing over provenance trails,
  and inference queries.

- [etckeeper](http://etckeeper.branchable.com/) - a helper tool for
  anyone administering their Linux-based system, which would store and
  automatically commit any changes within `/etc` into a VCS of your
  choice.  With its help you could track changes in your system
  configuration that could be indispensable during system malfunction
  troubleshooting.
