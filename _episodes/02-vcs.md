teaching: 210
exercises: 40
questions:

  which systems should be used?
objectives:
- Become familiar with version control systems for
  code and data, and relevant tools based on them
- Learn how to use version control systems to obtain, maintain, and

  used to help to guarantee reproducibility of the results
keypoints:

## What is a â€œversion control system" ([VCS])?

We all probably do some level of version control of our files,
documents, and even data files, but without a version control **system** ([VCS])
we do it in an ad-hoc manner:

[![A Story Told in File Names by Jorge Cham, http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive_print.php?comicid=1323](../fig/borrowed/phd052810s.png)](http://www.phdcomics.com)

So, in general, VCS systems help to **track versions** of digital artifacts
such as code (scripts, source files), configuration files, images,
documents, data -- original or generated (as outcome of the analysis).
With proper annotation of changes, VCS becomes the lab notebook for
changing content in the digital world.  Since all versions are stored,
VCS makes it possible to provide any previous version at any later
point in time.  You can see how it could be important for reproducing
previous results -- if your work's history is stored in a VCS, you just
need to get a previous version of your materials and carry out the
analysis using it.  You can also recover a file which you mistakenly
removed since previous version would be contained within VCS, so no
more "the cat ate my source code". For those features alone it is
worthwhile placing any materials you produce and care about under
some appropriate VCS.

Besides tracking changes, another main function of VCS is
**collaboration**. VCSs are typically used not only locally but across multiple
hosts. Any modern VCS supports
transfer and aggregation of versions of (or changes to) your
work among collaborators.  By using some public services (such as
[github]) you can also make them available to other online services
(such as [travis-ci](http://travis-ci.org)) 
that could be configured to react to any new change you
introduce and to perform prescribed actions.  Integration with such
services, which could automatically reanalyse data and
and verify that expected results still hold, provides another big benefit for
guaranteeing correct computations and reproducibility.

In this module we will first learn about

- general use of [Git] as a VCS to maintain not-so-large files (code,
configuration, text, etc)
- 3rd-party services worth learning to integrate with your VCS on
public hosting portals (e.g. on [github])
- VCS geared for managing data files ([git-annex])
- additional VCS-based tools that could help you to get better
control of your digital research artifacts and notes.

>  a thorough lesson of the main git commands and workflows.  Please

## 3rd party services

As you have learned in [Remotes in GitHub](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/07-github/)
section of the [Software Carpentry Git course](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
[github] website provides you a public (or private) storage for your Git repositories on the web.
GitHub website also allows 3rd-party websites to interact with your repositories 
to provide additional services, typically in a response to your submission of new changes
to your repositories. Visit [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace) for an
overview of the vast collection of such additional services.  Some services are free,
some are "pay-for-service".  Students could benefit from obtaining a 
[Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) to gain free access to
some services which otherwise would require a fee.

### Continuous integration

There is a growing number of online services providing 
**continuous integration** ([CI]) services.  Although free tier unlikely to provide
you with sufficient resources to carry our entire data analysis on your data,
you are encouraged to use CIs to verify your code reproducible and correct execution 
on a set of unit-tests or on a subset of the data.  For example, see 
[simple workflow](https://github.com/ReproNim/simple_workflow) code for 
the [A very simple, re-executable neuroimaging publication](https://f1000research.com/articles/6-124/))

#### Travis CI

[Travis CI] was one of the first free continuous integration services integrated
with GitHub.  It is free for projects available publicly on [github].

## Additional relevant helpers

- [sumatra](http://neuralensemble.org/sumatra) - manages
  and tracks projects based on numerical simulation or analysis,
  with the aim of supporting reproducible research. It can be thought
  of as an ''automated electronic lab notebook'' for
  simulation/analysis projects.

- [noworkflow](https://github.com/gems-uff/noworkflow) - captures a
  variety of provenance information and provides some analyses such
  as graph-based visualization, differencing over provenance trails,
  and inference queries.

- [etckeeper](http://etckeeper.branchable.com/) - a helper tool for
  anyone administering their Linux-based system, which would store and
  automatically commit any changes within `/etc` into a VCS of your
  choice.  With its help you could track changes in your system
  configuration that could be indispensable during system malfunction
  troubleshooting.
