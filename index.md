*Reproducibility* could not only be enforced via dedicated systems
facilitating automated and reproducible computation, but also could
taken as a principle to adhere to while performing any day-to-day
research activities.  Neuroimaging is heavily data and software driven
field of science, and as a result reproducibility in day to day
activities could be significantly improved by learning more about the
tools we use already daily, and how they could be used to not only
improve efficiency but also reproducibility.

This module guides through three somewhat independent topics, which
are in the heart of establishing and efficiently using common generic
resources: command line shell, version control systems (for code and
data), and distribution package managers.  It is very unlikely that you have
managed to avoid completely in your prior research activities, but it
is possible that you have under-utilized the power they are providing.
Gaining additional skills in any of those topics could help you to not
only become more efficient in your day-to-day research activities, but
also would lay foundation in establishing habits to make your work
actually more reproducible.
