This module guides you through three somewhat independent topics,
which are in the heart of establishing and efficiently using available
resources: command line shell, version control systems (for code and
data), and package management.  It is very unlikely that you have
managed to avoid completely in your prior research activities, but it
is possible that you have under-utilized the power they are providing.
Gaining additional skills in any of those topics could help you to not
only become more efficient in your day-to-day research activities, but
also would lay foundation in establishing habits to make your work
actually more reproducible.
