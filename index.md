*Reproducibility* could not only be enforced via dedicated systems
facilitating automated and reproducible computation, but also could
be taken as a principle to adhere to while performing any day-to-day
research activities.  Neuroimaging is a heavily data and software driven
field of science.  As a result, reproducibility in day to day
activities could be significantly improved by learning more about the
tools we use already daily, and how they could be used to not only
improve efficiency but also reproducibility.

This module guides through three somewhat independent topics, which
are in the heart of establishing and efficiently using common generic
resources: command line shell, version control systems (for code and
data), and distribution package managers.  It is very unlikely that you have
managed to avoid those tools completely in your prior research activities, but it
is possible that you have under-utilized the power they are providing.
Gaining additional skills in any of those topics could help you to not
only become more efficient in your day-to-day research activities, but
also would lay foundation in establishing habits to make your work
actually more reproducible.  Moreover these topics will be in the
foundation of future modules in the ReproNim curriculum.

To some degree, reproducibility requires on knowing **what**,
**when**, and **how** any particular analysis was carried out.
Therefore materials in this module will try to accent on helping to
answer those questions.  Before making accent on those questions,
referenced external materials (tutorials, lessons, etc) will provide a
more generic and more thorough presentation of the topics.
