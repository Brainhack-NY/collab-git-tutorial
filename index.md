Welcome to the Reproducible Basics Module!

This module will show how to use several core tools: shell, version control, etc. It will explain how proficiency in the use of these tools promotes reproducibility in your research.

This module is a part of the training curriculum from
the [ReproNim](http://www.reproducibleimaging.org) (Reproducible Neuroimaging) Center.

The [template](https://github.com/repronim/module-template) for all
ReproNim modules is based on templates from the
[Neurohackweek]({{site.nhw_site }}), [Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }})
and [Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}) workshops.
